Azure Artifacts:

Azure Artifacts is a package management solution integrated into Azure DevOps that allows you to create and share Maven, npm, and NuGet packages via feeds that can be both public and private to an organization with teams of any size.

Azure Artifacts also allows you to include upstream feeds into your configured package feeds to allow you to cache packages that your applications are dependent on inside your own feeds. This allows you to continue to take dependencies on packages that your application is using even if they are no longer available from the original source feed.
