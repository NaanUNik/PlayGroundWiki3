Why Azure Artifacts?
When choosing how you will manage your packages, often the decision comes down to a buy vs. build approach.

On the one hand, you can build a solution internally on a server and incur the management burden for this server and its security implications. For example: Hosting your own NuGet server in-house comes with administrative burdens such as server maintenance, security patching, access management and connectivity availability for developers and build systems.
