Azure Boards:

Boards within Azure Devops mimic the functionality of Atlassian's Issue & Project Tracking software, Jira. Within Boards you can create kanban boards, story items, feature items , backlog items, sprints and query items to query your entire project items.

Azure Boards offers Kanban boards, backlogs, and dashboards for flexible work tracking that is fully connected to the code and issues for all your projects â€“ big and small. A separate Azure DevOps Services subscription is required.
